# ReactJS-Weather-App

About


This is a personal project built in my spare time for learning purposes.

I used the Open Weather Map API to make calls to a restful api to return the current weather data.
This uses the Javascript Fetch AP along with React hooks.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
